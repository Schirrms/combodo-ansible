# itop_core_read

Heavily based on the itop_core_write role, so basically on the Combodo's itop.core.write.yml playbook, this role (ty to) delete a CI from the iTop database

This is a very experimental work, you probably shouldn't use it! OTOH, if you do, I'm very interested by your feedbacks ðŸ˜€
